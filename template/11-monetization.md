# Business Model

At the core of our business we want to give the possibility to users to lend/borrow items for free. However, to be able to continue developing the app we will need money. We will either get that by outsiders' contributions by selling our projects to investors to unlock funds, or we have also planned to sell potential data we collect so that users can receive targeted ads. We also plan to take commissions on everyone who rents their object at 30% of the value of the exchange with a minimum possible for the transaction.
We could also add a premium part, for example on the free version user are limited to x rent a month, we make the number large enough so itâ€™s never a problem for user, targeted clients are association or company that want to rent a lot of items
