# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

We target four main personas for this product: any student, associations, or small enterprises having small logistical needs, and individuals willing to share their unused objects. The key persona is the second one among the personas listed before.

Partagix addresses three high-level scenarios to enhance user experience and promote sustainable resource use. First, it helps users know where their belongings are and easily organize events that require specific items. Second, it encourages the use of products that would otherwise collect dust, maximizing their utility. Third, as an app built on community sharing, it emphasizes the importance of sharing items with friends and neighbors to fully leverage the platform's benefits.

## Success Criteria

User Adoption and Engagement:
- Target to onboard at least 50% of the associations on the EPFL campus
- Target to be used in at least 30% of the EPFL events
- Achieve a retention rate of at least 60% in the following semester

Feedback and Satisfaction
- Achieve a minimum average rating of 4 out of 5 stars on app stores within the first two months of launch
- Do quarterly survey to gather feedback and recommendations for the app
- Implement at least half of the recommendations/features (if they make sense) we got from the surveys
- Fix any bug that may be found by users as fast as possible


## Features Outside the Scope

Exclusion of the gamification: The idea would be to attribute points to users proportionally to the number of items and the type of items they have in their inventory. We would also have a scoreboard for the most borrowed items and the users with the biggest inventory. This is one of the features we want to implement, however it does not belong in the MVP.

Exclusion of the possibility to rent out your items on the app: the app was first thought of as a way to lend/borrow items for free. However, we are aware that it would attract more people if they could also rent their objects. This feature won’t be our first priority but is still something we have planned to implement
