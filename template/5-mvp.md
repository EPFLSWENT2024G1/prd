# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

We target four main personas for this product: any student, associations, or small enterprises having small logistical needs, and individuals willing to share their unused objects. The key persona is the second one among the personas listed before.

Partagix addresses three high-level scenarios to enhance user experience and promote sustainable resource use. First, it helps users know where their belongings are and easily organize events that require specific items. Second, it encourages the use of products that would otherwise collect dust, maximizing their utility. Third, as an app built on community sharing, it emphasizes the importance of sharing items with friends and neighbors to fully leverage the platform's benefits.
