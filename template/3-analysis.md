# Analysis of the Situation

There are different kinds of competing products : 

- Foundation lending objects to individuals on a monthly/yearly membership basis.

- Local peer-to-peer object lending solutions, most of them promote the zero-waste goal and are handled by municipality-sponsored associations.

- Peer-to-peer selling platforms, which does implement user-friendly applications, which offer a new life to unused objects, instead of throwing them away.

The two first kinds are not well marketed and don’t offer any user-friendly applications, which limits their impact and their concurrence potential.
The third kind is really appreciated by a great spectrum of the population, since everyone might have something to sell, their usage follows an exponential growth from year to year. However, they don’t represent a direct concurrence since they aim only at the buy/sell interaction, which doesn’t fit the problem of using an object rarely.

Complementary products are messaging applications which allow the owner and the borrower to meet, while using their favorite means of contact and google map which allows a user to see where an item is.
