# The Value Proposition


Partagix offers the possibility to use various items without owning them. This creates an incentive for return users since they no longer have to buy items that they might only use once in a while. It also allows the users to maximize the utility of some of their items when they don't use them, which leads to a lot less wasted money and items. The app, developed as a POC, i.e. during the class project, resonated with many associations on EPFL campus who will be the primary target user base.

For the associations as the customer, Partagix offers the following value proposition:
- As a limited budget organization, this provides the association with a modern, mobile-only platform that is very broadly used and deployed among the association, with the ultimate goal to have all types of items available for use when you need them.
- The app aims to replace mature software (i.e. truffe for the item borrowing management on EPFL). The design of the app will provide the possibility to deploy new services to answer the needs of the users.
- Partagix allows you to manage your inventory and to lend to other associations who might be in need or even to students who might have a use for your object.

Partagix offers a clear benefit to associations because it addresses a key pain point for them which is the logistics of your inventory.
Partagix is delivered as "software as a service" to the associations. This arrangement is convenient to the associations who don't always have the technical expertise and human resources to operate a software to manage their inventory.

By operating the service, we will gain insights into which features are most useful and relevant, and gather metrics that will facilitate the improvement of the app.
