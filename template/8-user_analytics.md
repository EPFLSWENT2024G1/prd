# User Analytics and Acceptance

Before the full rollout of the MVP, we must implement and put in place a pipeline
to collect relevant information on how users are using our application. This will
allow us to identify improvements and fix bugs. Additionally, we will track the
following metrics and leverage the following faucets to find PMF.

Usage Metrics:
- User Engagement: Frequency of app use, session duration, and navigation paths.
- Feature Use: which feature is the most used (inventory, loan, etcâ€¦)
- Conversion Rates: From app download to active usage.
- User Retention: Rate of returning users over time.
- Drop-off rate: what UI transitions have a high drop-off
  
Success Criteria:
- High user engagement/retention rates - more than 60% returning users and low drop-off rates 
- Low crash rates and quick resolution of identified issues.
  
User Analytics:
- Implement Google Analytics for behavioral tracking and Firebase Crash-lytics for stability monitoring.
- Anonymize data to comply with privacy standards.
  
A/B Testing Ideas:
- Test different navigation flows to find the most user-friendly layout.
- Experiment with different formats of displaying inventory and items
