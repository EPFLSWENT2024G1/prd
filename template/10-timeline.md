# Timeline/Resource Planning
We had 14 weeks to produce an MVP. The initial four weeks were dedicated to selecting and defining the project. Following this, we spent one week setting up our environment and preparing for production. The remaining nine weeks were focused on developing the MVP. Our progress was guided by four key milestones: the first two milestones were set at three-week intervals, and the remaining two milestones were set at two-week intervals, and by 10 sprints.

Milestone 1:
Sprint 1: 
Overview of the app, by starting the design on Figma
Set up the tools: CI, Firebase, Scrum board, and Android project
Added the authentication to the application

Sprint 2: 
Finished the setup: testing suite and database
Continued Figma
Started working on the application with the implementation of the first screens

Sprint 3: 
Continued working on screens
Added tests
Worked on milestone requirements:  ReadMe, architecture diagram, set sonar cloud full analysis.

For this milestone, we were lacking a lot of coverage to achieve the requested 80% line coverage.

Milestone 2:

Sprint 4: 
Increase the coverage
Fix bugs we found with the previous milestoneâ€™s submission

Sprint 5: 
Increase the coverage 
Worked on the QR generation
Worked on screens
Linked Google users and the users in our database
Fixed bugs
Updated the Figma
Fixed the APK build

Sprint 6: 
Fixed crashes
Added tests
Polished some screens, and functionalities
Worked on milestone requirements: add badges on read me, update figma, update architecture diagram, clean the project files

At this point, we had set up a way to store images in the database, and could generate QR codes for each item.

Milestone 3:
Sprint 7: 
Worked on new screens
Added functionalities to old screens
Modified the database to fit with the current implementation of the application by adding fields
Updated the Figma
Added tests
Full review of the application, and listed all the bugs found

Sprint 8: 
Fixed the bugs found in the previous sprint
Worked on screens
Start implementing the notification system
Worked on milestone requirements: set up this PRD, updated Figma, architecture diagram, and recorded a video of our application.

During these 2 weeks, we added deep-link to the QR code and started going over some finished screens to have a unified design.

Milestone 4:
Sprint 9:
Continued the notification system
Fixed bugs and little issues to start polishing the application

Sprint 10: 
Finished the notifications
Added a scan in the application
Made a way to cache images
Fixed some minor bugs and issues
Worked on the UI to have a complete dark mode and a coherence between all screens. 

In these last sprints, we choose to implement a few important things, and take a lot of time to fix all known issues, and UI to be able to submit a maximum polish MVP for this final submission.
