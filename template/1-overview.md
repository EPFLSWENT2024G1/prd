Enable people to lend and borrow material to and from others that are close by.

## Elevator Pitch
We all know the struggle of looking for something and not finding it, well that’s over. With
Partagix, easily keep track of what you have in your inventory, and connect with other users
to loan and borrow items. As an association, it’s even more valuable as they always loan
their material, especially in EPFL.
