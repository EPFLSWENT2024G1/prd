Whether it's among friends, neighbors, or members of associations, our app provides an efficient platform for sharing resources, reducing waste, and build community connections.

Partagix simplifies the process of item management through a user-friendly inventory system. Each item is cataloged with a unique QR code, allowing to easily track the item no matter where it is.

The app is free for everyone. The main target personas are:

1. Any students
  
2. Associations & Small Enterprises with simple logistic needs

3. Individuals having unused objects

Our application employs a split-app model with cloud synchronization to ensure real-time updates on inventories and reservations, supported by Firebase for backend management and push notifications. Partagix also offers offline functionalities, enabling users to manage their storage locally and synchronize changes once connected to the network. The app utilizes the device's camera for QR code scanning and GPS for location-based search results.
